I am Prabhsimrandeep Singh. Currently, I work in Cohesity as part of Core-Virtualization Team. Earlier, I worked in Juniper Networks. In Juniper, I worked on implemeting clocking and synchronization protocols like syncE and PTP.

I am a big fan of TV shows. In my free time, I go to [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/) to get some tech gossip.
