# Dynamic Programming

This has been one of the tricky ones. Only advice here is: Practice a lot. Practice until it starts "clicking" and then practice some more. I have always dreaded this thing. But I have gotten a hang of it. Still Sometimes I come across a problem which makes me scratch my head. I have discussed maybe 1/2 problems which felt interesting to me. As they have included lot of dp optimizations in them.
