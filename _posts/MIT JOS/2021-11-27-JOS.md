These are my notes while working on problems related to MIT JOS[^1]. JOS is a toy OS which has a unix like feel. I came across this course while I was checking out xv6(another cool toy OS). I have the code changes on Github. I haven't explained all the labs here but I have all the code changes in Github Repo [here](https://github.com/prabhsuggal/MIT-JOS).
