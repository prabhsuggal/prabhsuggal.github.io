### Exercise 1
> *i386_init identifies the file system environment by passing the type ENV_TYPE_FS to your environment creation function, env_create. Modify env_create in env.c, so that it gives the file system environment I/O privilege, but never gives that privilege to any other environment.*

> *Make sure you can start the file environment without causing a General Protection fault. You should pass the "fs i/o" test in make grade.*

This can be set using following changes in `env_create` function in `kern/env.c`.
```cpp
	e->env_type = type;
	if(e->env_type == ENV_TYPE_FS){
		e->env_tf.tf_eflags |= FL_IOPL_MASK;
	}
```

we are enabling the FL_IOPL_MASK only for FS user environment. This will prevent other environments to have I/O privileges.

#### Error Faced
When I tried to run fs i/o test, I kept facing this error.

Triple fault.  Halting for inspection via QEMU monitor.
```

In the beginning, I thought that it might be due to my errors. So I started checking if I missed something. Once I was sure that the error had nothing to do with my fix, I started debugging.

Using gdb, I tracked the code which was causing the Triple Fault.
```bash
Program received signal SIGTRAP, Trace/breakpoint trap.
The target architecture is set to "i386".
=> 0xf0105e61 <memset+53>:      rep stos %eax,%es:(%edi)
0xf0105e61 in memset (v=0xf03fe000, c=0, n=262144) at lib/string.c:131
131                     asm volatile("cld; rep stosl\n"
(gdb)
```

The complete disassembly is as follows:
```asm
f0105e5b:	09 d0                	or     %edx,%eax
		asm volatile("cld; rep stosl\n"
			:: "D" (v), "a" (c), "c" (n/4)
f0105e5d:	c1 e9 02             	shr    $0x2,%ecx
		asm volatile("cld; rep stosl\n"
f0105e60:	fc                   	cld
f0105e61:	f3 ab                	rep stos %eax,%es:(%edi)
f0105e63:	eb 06                	jmp    f0105e6b <memset+0x3f>
			: "cc", "memory");
	} else
		asm volatile("cld; rep stosb\n"
```

The panic was happening while running the following instruction:
```
f0105e61:	f3 ab                	rep stos %eax,%es:(%edi)
```
In this instruction, we are in a loop. We take the value from `eax` and write it into the register address given in `edi` and decrease `ecx`. Next we'll increment/decrement `edi` depending upon the direction flag. Since we have cleared the flag (using `cld` instruction), we are incrementing `edi`. This loop goes on until `ecx` is zero.

This seemed like a normal instruction to me. I went back to check the register set after panic.
```
EAX=00000000 EBX=00000000 ECX=0000f800 EDX=00000000
ESI=00000000 EDI=f0400000 EBP=f0124f68 ESP=f0124f5c
EIP=f0105e61 EFL=00000006 [-----P-] CPL=0 II=0 A20=1 SMM=0 HLT=0
```

It can be seen that `ecx` is non zero. This means that panic happened while the loop was running. Using qemu monitor, I collected the values of page directory. Here are the page directory values:
```

```

It cam be seen that VPA range which has been mapped to physical memory is `[f0000-f03ff]` and `[00000-003ff]`. Each index represent as virtual page. This made me think. See the loop which caused the panic increases the value of `edi` every iteration. At the time of fault, value of `edi` is `f0400000`. This is the first entry which is not mapped to any Physical page. This was my eureka moment. I had found the error.

I still wasn't sure why it has failed now. It never failed before. So there had been some changes which are now leading to increase in address which in turn, is causing a panic.

I tracked which variable address was sent to `memset` which in turn is fed into `edi`. It was `kern_pgdir`. And `kern_pgdir` is set using `boot_alloc` as follows:
```c
kern_pgdir = (pde_t *) boot_alloc(PGSIZE);

......
// here is the boot_alloc code:

// Initialize nextfree if this is the first time.
// 'end' is a magic symbol automatically generated by the linker,
// which points to the end of the kernel's bss segment:
// the first virtual address that the linker did *not* assign
// to any kernel code or global variables.
if (!nextfree) {
	extern char end[];
	nextfree = ROUNDUP((char *) end, PGSIZE);
}
```

Since kern_pgdir is the first address to be allocated, it is equal to `end`. Now who sets this `end`? I found this in the `kernel.ld` file as follows:
```
.bss : {
		PROVIDE(edata = .);
		*(.dynbss)
		*(.bss .bss.*)
		*(COMMON)
		PROVIDE(end = .);
	}
```

So `end` is the address which is available after mapping all the code/text/data related to kernel. But I was surprised. See this error has never happened before. So there must be some new data being added to kernel which is causing this overshoot in address.

I started checking all the segments and I found that we are packing the test binaries along with kernel image in this section:
```
/* The data segment */
	.data : {
		*(.data .data.*)
	}
```

So now we knew the culprit. I came across `kernel/Makefrag`, where we are packing all the test binaries.
```
# Binary program images to embed within the kernel.
# Binary files for LAB3
KERN_BINFILES :=	user/hello \
			user/buggyhello \
			user/buggyhello2 \
```

similar files are added for Lab 4 and Lab 5. each new lab was increasing the size of data segment and which in turn was increasing the value of `end` and thus `kern_pgdir`. This was leading to the dangerous error pasted above. Once I commented out the test files from earlier labs, everything worked fine and I was a pretty happy man.
