# About Me

My name is Prabhsimrandeep Singh. Currently I work in Juniper networks as a timing engineer. I work on implemeting clocking and synchronization protocols like syncE and PTP.

I am a big fan of TV shows. In my free time, I go to [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/) to get some tech gossip.
